# Voice Support

So you want to start playing some ðŸŽµtunesðŸŽ¶ in voice channels? Well let's get that going for you.

First you're going to want to get the voice dependencies installed:
```
pip install dis-snek[voice]
```
Now you've got those; let's make a simple play command to get you started.

```python
import dis_snek
from dis_snek.api.voice.audio import YTDLAudio

@dis_snek.slash_command("play", "play a song!")
@dis_snek.slash_option("song", "The song to play", 3, True)
async def play(self, ctx: dis_snek.InteractionContext, song: str):
    if not ctx.voice_state:
        # if we haven't already joined a voice channel
        # join the authors vc
        await ctx.author.voice.channel.connect()

    # Get the audio using YTDL
    audio = await YTDLAudio.from_url(song)
    await ctx.send(f"Now Playing: **{audio.entry['title']}**")
    # Play the audio
    await ctx.voice_state.play(audio)
```

Now just join a voice channel, and type run the "play" slash command with a song of your choice.

Congratulations! You've got a music-bot.
