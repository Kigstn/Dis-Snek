### `"What is this?"`
This is `Dis-Snek`, an API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. This wrapper is designed to be easy to use, and easily modified to suit your needs.

- [x] Modern and Pythonic API
- [x] Asynchronous operation
- [x] Proper rate limit handling
- [x] Dynamic cache with TTL support

___
### `"Is this just another discord.py fork?"`
While this library shares some features and stylistic choice with `discord.py`, its completely separate from them. We think `discord.py` is a fantastic library, but we disagree with the direction and design decisions made by it.

Compared to `discord.py`; `Snek` starts faster, responds faster, and is simpler to use. Especially compared to `Views`.
